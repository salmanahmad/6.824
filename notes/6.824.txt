Performance
Faulty Tolerance
	Goals:
		Availability
		Durability
		Consistency - data contract - data read returns the last data written
	Faults (failures to cope with):
		Network
			- packet loss, duplicated packets, out of order requests - TCP does not solve this because requests may span multiple tcp requests
			- Temporary or permanent failure (network partition) - can cause your data to diverge
		Server
			- Crashes and restarts
			- Crashes and does not restart (hardware failure)
			- Site wide failure (power goes out in the city, earth quake) - all servers fail at the same time
			- Bugs
			- Malice (someone breaks in)
			- Client failure (crash mid-transaction)
	Idea to copy with faults:
		- Retry
		- Replication
		- Repair
		- 
Consistency
