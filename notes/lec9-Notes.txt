First Lecture on Consistency.

Talk about memory and storage system, typically.

Meaning of reads and writes.

Performance vs ease of programming.

Today: sequential consistency.
Strict consistency
	Load and stores are stamped with issue time <-- Spanner does not use issue time
	Rule 1: Loads sees value from most recent stores in order of time
	Rule 2: Each machine executes in program order

Sequential consistency
	There exists an order of all operations such that:
	1) Each machines operation appear in program order
	2) Reads the value from most recent write in that order

Ivy
	Page modes: INV, RO, RW
	Invariants: A page is either RW on only one, INV on all others, or RO on >= 1, RW on none
