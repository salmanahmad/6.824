HARP File Systems

2b + 1 Servers - You can tolerate b failures

Failures:
1) Unreachable
2) Partitioned
3) Power failure
4) Crash and restart with no RAM but disk intact (kernel crash)
5) Server reboot but no disk and no RAM

Log contents:

MKDIR

5 Pointers into the log:

GLB: Global Lower Bound (all systems have done it)
LB: Lower Bound (it has written to disk. The file system has confirmed.)
AP: Application Point (it has made the system call. The apply process is a different process in the kernel, hence the second pointer)
CP: Commit Point. It replies to the client when all the backups have acked and the then moves up the commit point
FP: Furthest point



Failure Scenarios:

All scenarios have 5 servers.

S1 S2 S3 S4 S5

S1 - Primary
S2 - Backup
S3 - "
S4 - Witness (Promoted)
S5 - Witness



The AP CANNOT go past the CP. The disk is strictly a prefix of the log. This impacts the performance of the system but it is done to ensure that the primary does not do something that the backups have not seen.


UPS will give a signal to HARP so that harp will stop accepting client requests and begin writing to disk.
