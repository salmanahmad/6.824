Relaxed consistency is okay for social networking applications because those applications are generally not critical. It is not a missile defense system that has hard real-time requirements. If Sally's post about how Bob was mean to her and that obviously means that he likes her is delayed by a couple of minutes before Megan, her best friend, can read about it on Facebook - it is not the worst thing in the world. Then again, if Megan feels like other people learned about her BFF's new BF before she did, she could get angry and go on a killing spree so… I guess I change my mind. I don't agree with Yahoo. Relaxed consistency is NOT okay for social applications… Just think about the children…
