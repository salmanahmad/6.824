* Cluster storage systems
* blobs - blob ID

* Sharded + Partitioned
	- Leverage many many many servers and disks
	- Thousands of disks worth of throughputs
	- Allows you to install and upgrade the number of servers
	- Automated failure and recovery...

* When reading a paper the important things to look for:
	- What is the service to the client (the API)
	- Layout of distributed and shareded data
	- Finding the data (impacts fault tolerance and performance)
	- Add server
	- Replication
	- Respond to failure and re-replicate
	- Failure model 
	- Intuitive semantics and gaurantees (consistency, example: eventual consistency) 
	- Good performance
	- Ease of use and usefulness

* Stripping
