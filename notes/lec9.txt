If the manager does not wait for a confirmation the protocol is inherently flawed. Yes, we can assume that computers do not fail and that network is robust, but that does not mean there is a bug in the "client". By not waiting for a confirmation, the client may have ignored the request and as a result will request the incorrect page and cause consistency issues.
