Goals of primary/backup:
* Availability
* Correctness

Previously we handled single-fail-stop. 
Now we are going to handle network failures or partitions (temporary or permanent).
We are also going to handle repair.


How to ensure replicas have the same state?
* Copy whole state
* Start same. Same ops. Same order. Assume determism. They end up with identical state.


Lab 2 Goals
* Tolerate fail-stop + net failtures
* Reaplcement
* View Server - the view server is a single point of a failure
* You are trading off correctness with availability
* Handles split-brain nicely
* The view server determines "aliveness" by pinging.
